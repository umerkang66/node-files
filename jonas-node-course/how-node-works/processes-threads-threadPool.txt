Node runs on a SINGLE THREAD (that is basically just a sequence of a structure, thread is being a box where our code is executed in a computer's processors)

When the process is initialized: 
1)  All the code in the top levels runs (not inside any callback function)

2)  All the modules are required
3)  Register event callbacks
4)  EVENT LOOP finally starts running (it is where most of the work is done in our application, in other words it is the heart of the node application)

5) Some tasks are too heavy to be handled by the event loop (that will blocks the execution)
that's where THREAD_POOL comes in. In thread pool there are four different threads that are separated from the main single thread (these 4 threads can be configured to 128 threads, but usually, these 4 are enough). Event Loop can automatically offload heavy tasks to the thread pool (all this happens automatically behind the scenes)

Heavy Tasks Like: 
1)  File System APIs
2)  Cryptography
3)  Compression
4)  DNS Lookup
