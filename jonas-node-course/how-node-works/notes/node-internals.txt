NodeJs --> Node is a JavaScript runtime based on google v8 engine. Node ties all the libraries together and provides us the abstraction in javascript. We access these libraries in javascript

There are two Libraries in node js:
1)  v8 engine
2)  Libuv library

v8 engine: It is written in c++ and javascript

Libuv Library: It is open-source library (written in only c++) with a strong focus on asynchronous i/o. This library gives access to the underlying operating system, file system, networking, and more.
The Most important features of node js are Event-Loop and Thread-Pool that are implemented by Libuv Library

EventLoop: It is responsible for handling easy-tasks like executing callbacks, and network i/o

ThreadPool: It is responsible for handling heavy-tasks, like file access or compression

There are some other libraries:
1) http-parser: for parsing http
2) c-ares: for handling dns request stuff
3) OpenSSL: for cryptography
4) zlib: for compression
